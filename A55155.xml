            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING for the moſt part perſued the very ſame <hi>Method</hi> in writing this <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that I uſed in that of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> I ſhall have little occaſion further to enlarge my ſelf here, than to acquaint the <hi>Reader</hi> with thoſe few <hi>alterations</hi> he will find I have made, which I doubt not he will judg, ſo advantageous and reaſonable, that he will eaſily approve of what I have done, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of all levity, and unſettledneſs of temper.</p>
            <p>The firſt and cheifeſt of which <hi>alterations,</hi> he will meet with in the <hi>Map;</hi> where he will find many <hi>Letters,</hi> as well as <hi>figures</hi> ſet over the <hi>Sheilds,</hi> and theſe divided with lines drawn between them; the <hi>figures</hi> on the right hand each <hi>Eſcocheon,</hi> ſhewing what <hi>Armes</hi> belong to the <hi>Houſes,</hi> as they did in <hi>Oxfordſhire;</hi> and the <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> on the left hand diviſion, ſhewing on the contrary what <hi>Houſes,</hi> belong to each <hi>Armes:</hi> ſo that whereas in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> upon the ſight of a <hi>houſe,</hi> one could eaſily find the <hi>Armes</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to it; in this, upon ſight of any mans <hi>Armes</hi> (which are eaſily met with, being all placed in <hi>alphabetical</hi> order) one may as quickly find the <hi>houſe</hi> belonging to them; by ſeeking the ſame <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> over the <hi>Armes,</hi> in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Limbs of the <hi>Map,</hi> and finding where they meet in a right angle: the <hi>houſes</hi> (as well as <hi>pariſhes</hi> and <hi>villages,</hi> whereof there is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> alſo annext to this <hi>Hiſtory</hi>) being always within or ſomewhere at leſt touching the <hi>lines</hi> of the <hi>ſquares,</hi> wherever theſe <hi>Ltters</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> meet; that are ſet over, or after, thoſe <hi>Armes,</hi> or <hi>pariſhes.</hi> So that the <hi>Reader</hi> hereby tho' never ſo great a ſtranger, may not only when he ſees a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> ſeat with <hi>figures</hi> annext, quickly find whoſe' tis; but (which is of greater uſe) if he know but any perſons <hi>name</hi> in the <hi>County,</hi> he ſhall as quickly find his <hi>Armes,</hi> and whereabout he lives; as he may alſo any <hi>Town, Pariſh,</hi> or <hi>village,</hi> if he read any thing remarkable in this <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> found or done there, and would know whereabout it is ſituate in the <hi>County.</hi>

            <p>Concerning the <hi>diſtances,</hi> and <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>Miles</hi> in the <hi>Map,</hi> they were taken after the ſame manner as in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and ſet off in the <hi>Map</hi> at the rate of two miles in an inch, as may be found upon compariſon of a <hi>Rule</hi> with the <hi>Scale,</hi> and of the

            <p>Which is all wherein the <hi>Map</hi> differs from the former: and as for the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> it ſelf, I have ſo little reaſon to repent me of the <hi>Method</hi> I follow'd in that of <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> that I hope it differs not from it at all; unleſs in caſe of <hi>meliority,</hi> viz. in a greater variety of parallel <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> whereby the more unuſual ones, I met with in this <hi>County,</hi> have been all along confirm'd; and in the determination of more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult <hi>Queſtions;</hi> whereby there is ſcarce a <hi>Chapter</hi> in this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> but has been render'd the more conſiderable, I mean in the <hi>ſtating</hi> of ſome one, or more of them: which I hope all men will find done with that accuracy, that they will accept of them in excuſe of the long delay, that has partly been made upon that account, in the publiſhing this <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> it having been really ſo far from a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that I think I can ſatisfy any reaſonable man, that this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> could not have poſſibly been, what (I hope) it is, in a much leſs time.</p>
            <p>I know 'twill be objected I publiſh't it in print, that this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſhould be exſtant by ſuch a time preciſely, now long ſince paſt; which I here as publicly deny, as ever it 'twas aſſerted: for the truth whereof I appeal to the very papers ſubſcribed by the hands of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> who encouraged the <hi>work,</hi> and if it be found otherwiſe then is here profeſs't, let me never enjoy the benefit of them; nor of any thing there mention'd, if I doe not litterally and with advantage, make all good I there promiſed: which I hope is as much as will be expected of me, by any judicious unprejudiced perſons, and for others, I am not concern'd to give them ſatisfaction.</p>

The <hi>material</hi> cauſes 'tis true may be various, either ſimple or compound: as the meer corruption of the ſimple Air alone upon a long ſtagnation in the Coal-rooms, and the rifts and clefts of the rock of coal it ſelf, may be its <hi>material</hi> cauſe indeed, but the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of ſuch a damp, I take to be the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe cavities, without which, the <hi>Air</hi> would never have corrupted; no more than <hi>water</hi> which never corrupts till it ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53186:92"/>when indeed like the <hi>Air</hi> it becomes poyſonous, though poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to that degree, the <hi>Air</hi> being a body much finer, and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the more tender parts of the body.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Whence it is that in the old <hi>works,</hi> wherein there has been no digging for a long time, no laveing, drawing, or pumping of water, all which keep the <hi>Air</hi> in motion, and the <hi>water</hi> from canckering, theſe <hi>damps</hi> are moſt frequent and moſt dangerous. Whence it is too that the <hi>Works</hi> where the bed of coal is thin, and admits of but few or no ſuch rifts or clefts for the <hi>Air</hi> to ſtagnat or corrupt in, are ſeldom or never troubled with them. Upon which account 'tis likewiſe that though a bed of coal have many of theſe rifts, and large ones too; yet as long as there is a profluence of <hi>water</hi> through them, there is no danger of their entertaining ſuch <hi>damps;</hi> which as ſoon as made dry by a <hi>Sough</hi> or <hi>free-Level,</hi> the ſame <hi>Mine</hi> ſhall become much more lyable to them; the wholſom <hi>Air</hi> that was in them whilſt kept in motion by the <hi>flux</hi> of the <hi>water</hi> (having little or no communication with that above ground) now ſtagnating and corrupting to that degree, that it not only extinguiſhes the glowing heat of coales, and the flame of candles, torches &amp;c. but the <hi>flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula vitae</hi> too in moſt living creatures, ſo that the <hi>Animal</hi> which reſpires it, ſome times expires with it too. And as it is in <hi>ſimple damps</hi> made out of corrupted <hi>Air</hi> only, ſo it is in the compound ones of one or more <hi>minerals,</hi> whether viſible or inviſible; whether ariſeing from the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of <hi>coale</hi> it ſelfe, or as ſome will have one of them, from the <hi>ſcent</hi> of <hi>vegetables,</hi> or 2 from the ſteams of the <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> breath, and ſweat of their bodies, together with the ſmoak of the candles they work by; or 3 from ſulphureous, arſenical, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, or other ſuch <hi>mineral</hi> ſteams that may be incident to <hi>Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works:</hi> for to all theſe they aſcribe a particular ſort of <hi>Damp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="44">44. The firſt ſort whereof, which ariſes from the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of <hi>coal</hi> it ſelf, is ſaid to happen only in ſuch <hi>grooves</hi> where they make uſe of great fires to ſoften the rocks to make them yeild to the pick-Axe, which ſending up with the <hi>ſmoak</hi> a ſulphureous or perhaps an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenical vapour, in probability may ſo infect the quiet Air in ſuch deep caverns, as to render it unfit for reſpiration: it haveing been long indeed obſerved that ſuch <hi>mines</hi> are ſeldom or never free from <hi>damps.</hi> And of this ſort perhaps are the <hi>damps</hi> of the <hi>coalworks</hi> about <hi>Chedle;</hi> where above the <hi>Mines</hi> they have a rock of a greyiſh colour, call'd <hi>Pox-ſtone,</hi> ſo very hard, that where they doe not luckily meet with a cleft, they are forced to put fire to it, which in ſome time will make it flaw, or at leaſt ſo ſoften it, that the pick-axes will enter it, which otherwiſe would not work away ſo much in a day, as will fill a hat. And yet theſe <hi>damps</hi> are neither viſible nor noiſome, nor will they take fire, but are ſo groſs &amp; moiſt that they extinguiſh
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53186:92"/>it &amp; are ſuddenly mortal. Nor is the <hi>peas bloſſom damp</hi> (whereof we have an account from the learned <hi>Martin Liſter</hi> Phyſitian at <hi>York</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="bottom">

Of this ſort I enquired in the eaſt part of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> where the <hi>Moore-lands</hi> bound upon the <hi>Peak-Country</hi> of <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> and found it not only there, but as far as I could learn, to be the moſt common damp in the Country, it making their candles firſt to diminiſh, to burn round, and at length to goe out, perfuming the <hi>Stauls</hi> at the ſame time with a faint ſweet ſmell, as thoſe in <hi>Darbyſhire</hi> doe, only with this difference, that here they are ſaid to be ſometimes viſible, ſhewing like a thin ſmoak, which may be ſeen not only in the <hi>grooves,</hi> but fuming out at the top of the pit. But here they are wiſer (where they goe for their coal 40 or 50 yards deep, and have no ſuch thing as <hi>trefoil;</hi> for many miles, and yet have this damp) than to think it proceeds either from <hi>peas</hi> or <hi>trefoil;</hi> it being rather apprehended to ariſe from the <hi>Workmens</hi> breath and ſweat, mixt with the ſteams of the golden <hi>Marchaſite</hi> or braſs lumps, than any thing elſe.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Not much unlike that (only in its fatality) we call the <hi>Globe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damp,</hi> thought to be compounded of the Workmens breath &amp;c. and ſweat of their bodies, together with the ſmoak of the candles they work by, which aſcending to the uppermoſt parts of the <hi>grooves,</hi> there condenſe ſo much, that they become <hi>viſible</hi> in the form and bigneſs of a <hi>foot ball,</hi> ſeeming to be cover'd with a ſkin, of of the thickneſs and colour of a <hi>Cobweb.</hi> Theſe if by any caſualty they come to be broken, they immediatly diſperſe themſelves, and ſuffocat all the company, being altogether as mortal though not ſo violent; as the <hi>fulminating damps</hi> mention'd by the ſame worthy Gent. and the ingenious Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> of <hi>Broomhall</hi> in <hi>Yorkſh:</hi> to have happen'd not long ſince at <hi>Haſle-berg-hills,</hi> and at <hi>Wingerſworth</hi> within two miles of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> An. 1675<note n="m" place="bottom">

                  </note>, though it may indeed be allowed to be a ſocial cauſe: the oylineſs and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the coal may be neceſſary indeed for its ſo quik takeing fire, but this will not account for its violence and noiſe: there muſt therefore certanly be ſomewhat of <hi>Niter,</hi> joyn'd with the <hi>bitumen</hi> and <hi>ſulphur</hi> in the coal, to perform this feat. That <hi>bitumen</hi> muſt be a concurrent cauſe of ſuch <hi>damps,</hi> I take to be evident indeed from hence, that in the relation at large of the <hi>fire damp</hi> above, it is ſaid that it would play upon the ſurface of the water of a <hi>rainbow</hi> colour; and that <hi>Sulphur</hi> muſt alſo be an ingredient, I take to be as plain, for that in the ſame relation, it is expreſsly ſaid, that in working the <hi>roach</hi> of coal 5 yards thick, when they came near the bottom, where the water was not mixt with <hi>ſulphureous</hi> and <hi>braſſy Metalls,</hi> the <hi>fire-damp</hi> was neither ſeen or heard of; and that <hi>Niter</hi> muſt alſo have a ſhare in ſuch dreadfull <hi>Scenes</hi> as theſe, I take to be as manifeſt as the facts themſelves, ſince no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſions can be made without it, and that the ſmoak that follows the fireing ſuch <hi>damps,</hi> is on all hands confeſt to have the ſmell and colour of <hi>Gunpowder.</hi> But of this matter further, when I come to conſider, how it comes to paſs that ſo many of the <hi>coal-pits</hi> take fire of themſelves.</p>
               <p n="48">48. There is another ſort of <hi>damp</hi> they call <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Air.</hi> i. e. want of Air ſufficient for the breathing of <hi>Animals,</hi> and burning of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</hi> This ſort of <hi>damp</hi> (improperly ſo call'd) is that they commonly meet with in long <hi>Soughs</hi> for conveyance of water from the coale; or when to avoid charge they run in their work as far underground as poſſible, for wining of coal, without leting down a new ſhaft. The cauſe of which ſort of <hi>damp</hi> is cetainly nothing elſe, but the want of communication with the <hi>Air</hi> above ground, it being found by experience that the further a Man goes, into one of theſe <hi>coal-levels,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53186:94"/>the flame of his candle will gradually grow leſs and leſs, till it goes quite out, and his difficulty of breathing greater and greater, till he cannot breathe at all, <hi>&amp; vice verſa</hi> in his return. And ſo I found it in my entrance into the above mention'd <hi>Footerill</hi> at <hi>Apedale,</hi> where before we came 200 yards into it, 2 of the 3 candles I had in with me, went quite out, and the third was juſt expiring, in ſo much that I was forc't to make a retreat. This ſort of <hi>damp</hi> is nothing ſo dangerous as ſome of the former, becauſe not ſurpriſing, but comeing ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, that a man may releive Himſelf at pleaſure, though it be true enough too, that this will kill <hi>Animals,</hi> as well as extinguiſh <hi>coales</hi> or <hi>candles,</hi> if they be far enough removed from the <hi>Air</hi> above ground, and continue long enough there.</p>
               <p n="49">49.

               <p n="60">60. Laſtly, to the <hi>ſignes</hi> whereby they find <hi>coal,</hi> and the methods they uſe in finding and diging them; which though they properly indeed belong to the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> yet for the reaſons above mention'd, I ſhall treat of them here. For finding of <hi>coal,</hi> if in a place where never any have bin diſcover'd, they firſt conſult the <hi>ſprings</hi> if any near, to ſee whether they can find any <hi>coal water</hi> i. e. an acid water having a <hi>Car,</hi> or yellow ſediment: above ground they look for a <hi>ſmut</hi> as they call it, i. e. a <hi>friable black earth:</hi> when they meet with either of theſe, they reckon themſelves under circumſtances tolerably good for the finding of <hi>coal,</hi> which prompt them next ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>boar</hi> or <hi>ſink</hi> a <hi>pit;</hi> the former whereof if they think the <hi>coal</hi> lyes ſhallow, is the better of the two; but if it lye deep, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes almoſt as expenſive as <hi>ſinking</hi> a <hi>pit,</hi> the drawing the rods of the <hi>Augre</hi> expending very much time, in reguard they are many, and that it muſt be done frequently; beſides its leaving the <hi>Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> under great uncertainties, in reſpect of the courſe of the <hi>coal,</hi> the <hi>draining</hi> it, its <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>thickneſs;</hi> all which are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the <hi>ſearch</hi> of <hi>coal.</hi> Whereas by ſinking, all theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties are removed, only the <hi>charge</hi> is certain, for that in all <hi>virgin grounds</hi> where the <hi>coal</hi> lyes intire and untouch't, there is always a great <hi>affluence</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> which many times brings the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat inquiſitor,</hi> not only under a neceſſity of a great expence for <hi>drawing</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> but ſometimes too, to let Himſelf know that the work can never turn to account: However of the two, this is reekon'd the better, for the reaſons above mentiond.</p>
               <p n="61">61. As it is alſo where ſearch is made, where <hi>coal</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known to be, either by their appearing to the day any

               <p n="62">62.

               <p n="63">63. I went down into one of theſe <hi>hanging mines</hi> at <hi>Harding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwood</hi> belonging to the aforemention'd Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> of this <hi>County,</hi> where He ſhewed me a <hi>level</hi> of 35 yards of <hi>roach</hi> as it lay in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>diping</hi> line above the water, which came to 35 foot <hi>perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:53186:99"/>diping one foot to every yard: in this <hi>Level</hi> He had five <hi>wallings</hi> or <hi>Stauls,</hi> out of which they dug the <hi>coal</hi> in great blocks; between the <hi>wallings</hi> there were <hi>ribbs</hi> left, and paſſages through them called <hi>thurlings,</hi> which give convenience of <hi>Air,</hi> and paſſage for the <hi>coal</hi> out of one <hi>walling</hi> into another, which in all <hi>coal mines</hi> ſtand thick or thin, partly according to the ſubſtance of the <hi>coal;</hi> moſt commonly thiner in the lower <hi>wallings,</hi> which are therefore conſequently wider; and thicker in the upper <hi>wallings,</hi> which muſt be therefore narrower, the <hi>coal</hi> of the upper <hi>wallings</hi> being generally naſher; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſofter and more friable then that of the lower <hi>wallings,</hi> which are more firme and ſolid: whence they compare the <hi>coal</hi> of the upper <hi>wallings</hi> to bruſh wood, as burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwifter, ſweeter, and clear from ſoot; and that of the lower <hi>wallings</hi> to hard wood, as being more ſolid and laſting, though making more ſoot. But in this point they mind not ſo much the <hi>coal</hi> as the <hi>roof,</hi> the <hi>wallings</hi> or <hi>ſtaules</hi> being made narrower or wider, according as that is found better or worſe, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times being nothing but a <hi>baſs,</hi> full of <hi>joynts;</hi> and perhaps ſoluble in the Air, they are forced then to leave a yard of <hi>coal</hi> that lyes next under it for a <hi>roof,</hi> and make their <hi>wallings</hi> narrow: whereas on the contrary where there is a <hi>ſtrong rock</hi> next the <hi>coal,</hi> and no <hi>baſs,</hi> they will then venture their <hi>roof</hi> ſo far ſometimes as to make their <hi>wallings</hi> 8 or 9 yards wide, which <hi>roof</hi> of <hi>rock</hi> puts me in mind that tis time to ſhut up this tedious diſcourſe of <hi>coal,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſucceding <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Stone.</hi>

               <p n="64">64. But before I enter on it, perhaps it may not be amiſs to add a word or two concerning the Methods they uſe in laying their coales <hi>dry,</hi> when any thing troubled with <hi>water,</hi> which becauſe they are not ſo frequently, or ſo much, as in ſome other <hi>Countrys,</hi> they are not forced upon ſuch variety of expenſive <hi>Engines.</hi> The ordinary ways they uſe are by <hi>Sough</hi> or by <hi>Gin.</hi> The former when they have the advantage of fall of ground enough, which they try by the <hi>Level,</hi> and then either dig a trench open to the ſurface, like a great ditch as deep as the <hi>coale,</hi> or drive in a <hi>cuniculus</hi> about a yard <hi>diameter</hi> to the pavement (if they can) of the loweſt dip, of the loweſt <hi>meaſure</hi> of <hi>coale,</hi> which without more adoe will lay all the <hi>coal</hi> ſo dry, toward the <hi>Crop,</hi> that it may be workt without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. But when they have no fall, they draw it up by <hi>Gin,</hi> which is made either bigger, or leſs, according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the work; the leſs they call a <hi>Iack,</hi> which is either turned by <hi>Men,</hi> as requiring leſs ſtrength; or by <hi>Horſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>Owner</hi> thinks moſt fit.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53186:108"/>ſix <hi>ſoughs</hi> made under the <hi>Furnace</hi> (as it is at <hi>Mare</hi>) in parallel lines to the ſtream that turns the <hi>wheel</hi> which compreſſes the <hi>bellows,</hi> to drain away the <hi>moiſture</hi> from the <hi>furnace,</hi> for ſhould the leaſt drop of water come into the <hi>Metall,</hi> it would blow up the <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> and the <hi>Metall</hi> would fly about the <hi>Workmens</hi> ears; from which <hi>ſoughs</hi> they muſt alſo have a conical pipe about 9 inches at bottom, ſet to convey the <hi>damps</hi> from them into the open Air, which too otherwiſe would annoy the <hi>Workmen</hi> even to death.</p>
               <p n="24">24. From the <hi>Furnaces,</hi> they bring their <hi>Sows</hi> and <hi>pigs</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> when broken aſunder, and into lengths, to the <hi>Forges;</hi> which are of two ſorts, but commonly (as at <hi>Cunſall</hi>) ſtanding together under the ſame roof; one whereof they call the <hi>Finery,</hi> the other the <hi>Chafery:</hi> they are both of them <hi>open hearths,</hi> upon which they place great heaps of <hi>coal,</hi> which are blown by <hi>bellows</hi> like to thoſe of the <hi>Furnaces,</hi> and compreſſed the ſame way, but nothing near ſo large. In theſe two <hi>forges</hi> they give the <hi>Sow</hi> and <hi>piggs</hi> 5 ſeverall <hi>heats</hi> before they are perfectly wrought into <hi>barrs.</hi> Firſt in the <hi>Finery</hi> they are melted down as thin as lead, where the <hi>Metall</hi> in an hour thickens by degrees into a lump or maſs, which they call a <hi>loop,</hi> this they bring to the great <hi>Hammer</hi> raiſed by the motion of a <hi>water-wheel,</hi> and firſt beat it into a thick ſquare, which they call a <hi>half bloom.</hi> Then <hi>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>
                  </hi> they put it into the <hi>Finery</hi> again for an hour, and then bring it again to the ſame <hi>Hammer,</hi> where they work it into a <hi>bloom,</hi> which is a ſquare barr in the middle, and two ſquare knobs at the ends, one much leſs then the other, the ſmaller being call'd the <hi>Ancony</hi> end, and the greater the <hi>Mocket head.</hi> And this is all they doe at the <hi>Finery.</hi> Then 3. the <hi>Ancony end</hi> is brought to the <hi>Chafery,</hi> where after it has been heated for a quarter of an hour, it is alſo brought to the <hi>Hammer,</hi> and there beat quite out to a <hi>bar,</hi> firſt at that end; and after that, the <hi>Mocket head</hi> is brought alſo 4. to the <hi>chafery,</hi> which being <hi>thick,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires two <hi>heats,</hi> before it can be wrought under the <hi>Hammer,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bars of ſuch ſhapes and ſizes as they think fitteſt for <hi>Sale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Whereof, thoſe they intend to be cut into <hi>rodds,</hi> are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the <hi>ſlitting Mills,</hi> where they firſt break or cut them cold with the force of one of the <hi>Wheels</hi> into ſhort lengths; then they are put into a <hi>furnace</hi> to be heated red hot to a good height, and then brought ſingly to the <hi>Rollers,</hi> by which they are drawn even, and to a greater length: after this another <hi>Workman</hi> takes them whilſt hot and puts them through the <hi>Cutters,</hi> which are of divers ſizes, and may be put on and off, according to pleaſure: then another lays them ſtraight alſo whilſt hot, and when cold binds them into <hi>faggots,</hi> and then they are fitting for ſale. And thus I have given an account of the <hi>Iron works</hi> of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> from the <hi>Ore</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:53186:109"/>to the <hi>ſlitting Mills,</hi> as they are now exerciſed in their perfection; the improvement whereof we ſhall find very great, if we look back upon the <hi>Methods</hi> of our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> who made <hi>Iron</hi> in <hi>foot blaſts</hi> or <hi>bloomeries,</hi> by Mens treading the bellows, by which way they could make but one little lump or <hi>bloom</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> in a day, not 100 weight; leaving as much <hi>Iron</hi> in the <hi>Slag</hi> as they got out. Whereas now they will make two or three <hi>tuns</hi> of <hi>caſt Iron</hi> in 24 hours: leaving the <hi>Slag</hi> ſo poore, that the <hi>Founders</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not melt them again to profit. Not to mention again the vaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they have from the new Invention of <hi>ſlitting Mills,</hi> for cutting their <hi>barrs</hi> into <hi>rodds,</hi> above what they had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Thus I ſay the <hi>Iron-works</hi> are exerciſed in their <hi>perfection,</hi> and all their prncipal <hi>Iron</hi> undergoes all the foremention'd preparations; not but that for ſeveral purpoſes, as for the <hi>backs</hi> of <hi>Chimneys, Garden-rolls,</hi> and ſuch like; they uſe a ſort of <hi>caſt-Iron</hi> which they take out of the <hi>Receivers</hi> of the <hi>Furnaces,</hi> as ſoon as it is melted, in great <hi>Ladles,</hi> and pour it into <hi>moulds</hi> of fine ſand, in like manner as they caſt the other ſofter <hi>Metalls.</hi> Thus the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Will.

But it would be endleſs to enumerat the <hi>Quarries</hi> of this County, ſhould I continue to proſecute ſuch as thoſe above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd; wherefore I ſhall now reſtrain my ſelf only to ſuch as are ſome way or other more remarkable than others: amongſt which I think I may reckon the <hi>Quarry</hi> at <hi>Penford</hi> in the Lands of Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> which lies in depth 14. or 15. yards as has been ſeen by many, ſome of the workmen aſſert it at leaſt 20. yards thick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they certainly know no bottom; the deeper they go the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the grit; and for colour it is <hi>whitiſh</hi> at the top, then <hi>rediſh</hi> to 10.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53186:112"/>or 12. yards, and then whiter than at top, for 5. or 6. yards more; it being all of it good <hi>weatherſtone,</hi> but not enduring the <hi>fire.</hi> As the ſtone of the <hi>Quarry</hi> in <hi>Purton</hi> park will, which is both a good <hi>weather</hi> and <hi>fire ſtone</hi> too, and ſo free from <hi>clefts,</hi> that a ſtone may be had of any Magnitude, as big as any of the <hi>Guglia's</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> nay I was told by one of the <hi>Maſons</hi> that he could undertake to get a ſtone at this <hi>Quarry</hi> fifty yards long, and that but two or three years before I came thither, they actually had gotten one (though they had no occaſion for any ſuch) about fifty foot long: of theſe large ſtones there are very good examples in <hi>Purton</hi> houſe belonging to the right Worſhipful Sr. <hi>Walter Wrotteſley</hi> Baronet, a Perſon of that great reputation in his <hi>Country,</hi> that his memory will never dye; till Loyalty and Integrity, Prudence and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, be overborn by Faction, Impudence and Ignorance, and become unregarded, and of no eſteem amongſt us.</p>
               <p n="33">33. The <hi>Quarry</hi> at <hi>Bilſton</hi> is alſo very remarkable, it lying in beds in <hi>plano Horizontis,</hi> one under another, 12 beds deep; every bed being thicker then that above it, an inch or more; ſo that the lower bed is about a yard thick of which they make <hi>troughs, ciſterns</hi> &amp;c. Some of the <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>ſtone</hi> riſing ſo large and even, that Mr. <hi>Hoo</hi> of <hi>Bradeley</hi> got one here 8 yards long, naturally ſo very even, that in the whole length it did not <hi>bevel,</hi> or depart from a true <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> above an inch. Some of the <hi>ſtone</hi> dug at this <hi>Towne</hi> is alſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſtreaked black, whereof there are elegant patterns, in the <hi>Garden</hi> at the right worſhipful Sr. <hi>Henry Gough's</hi> at <hi>Pury-Hall.</hi> I met likewiſe with a white ſtone thus mark't black, uſed in the building of the new <hi>Dormitory</hi> at <hi>Kingſton</hi> Church by the right Worſhipful Sr. <hi>Simon Degg</hi> Knight, but whereabout it was dug I muſt confeſs I forgot to ask, but ſuppoſe it could not be very far off.</p>
               <p n="34">34. The ſtone of the <hi>Quarry</hi> above mention'd at <hi>Purton</hi> ſerves alſo for <hi>Grinding ſtones,</hi> which gives me occaſion to treat of them next: which I find are eſteemed ſo much the better, by how much they are made of a finer <hi>Grit:</hi> whence it is that the <hi>Grinding-ſtones</hi> dug near <hi>Biddulph-Hall</hi> of a red larger grit are not accounted ſo good as thoſe dug at <hi>Heaton,</hi> a Village between <hi>Swithamley</hi> and <hi>Ruſhton Spencer,</hi> which are of a grayiſh colour, and of a fine ſmall <hi>grit.</hi> But not ſo fine as thoſe dug at <hi>Bilſon,</hi> which are of ſo ſmall a grit, that they are uſeful only for fine thin edg'd tooles, ſuch as <hi>Knives, Ciſſers, Razers,</hi> &amp;c. and are better than the <hi>Grinding-ſtones</hi> brought out of <hi>Derby-ſhire,</hi> which are uſed chiefly for thicker edg'd tooles, ſuch as <hi>Axes, Hatchets, Chiſells, Adds, Twy-bills,</hi> &amp;c. Or thoſe lately found, about 5 years ſince, at <hi>Over Arley,</hi> near the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage houſe, and in the <hi>manor</hi> of <hi>Heck-ſtones</hi> adjoyning to the glebe

By <hi>Tranſplantation,</hi> which is much the better and ſurer way, if one deſigne to have <hi>Fruits</hi> out of ſeaſon (for the <hi>Budds</hi> nip't, ſometimes will never make a ſecond attempt,) thus <hi>Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrys</hi> tranſplanted before they <hi>Flower,</hi> and tranſplanted again in <hi>Autumn,</hi> if the Winter prove mild and temperate (which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary in both caſes,) they may and doe perhaps, more frequently then noted, produce their <hi>Fruit</hi> about that time of year.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Of unuſual <hi>Herbaceous Plants</hi> now cultivated in the fields, the <hi>Vicia Sylveſtris, ſive Cracca,</hi> the wild <hi>Vetch,</hi> here call'd <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs</hi> has been obſerved in ſome parts to doe ſo well in <hi>Meddows,</hi> that it advances all ſtarven weak Cattle above any thing yet known.

For the better underſtanding of which new doctrine, let the <hi>Reader</hi> take notice, that the low grounds where theſe trees are now found, when they ſtood and flouriſh't, in all probability were tolerably dry land; for the trees whilſt growing (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the moiſture ſhot into the valleys then, as now,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſpent it in their nouriſhment, and their as conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations; which when cut down, there being no expence for it, the <hi>valleys</hi> at length grew into <hi>pooles;</hi> the waters whereof being thickend with perpetuall <hi>deterrations,</hi> or Earth brought from the <hi>hills</hi> and <hi>higher grounds</hi> by ſhowers in wet, and winds in dry weather, they came at laſt to be <hi>Moſſes</hi> or <hi>Fenns</hi> thus covering the trees as we now find them: which I take to be the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of many of our <hi>Moſſes,</hi> though afterwards they increaſe by new graſs and ſedg annually growing upon the rottings of the old of the former year, and ſo onward.</p>
               <p n="46">46.

Now that there are ſuch <hi>deterrations</hi> or perpetual diminutions of all <hi>hills</hi> (except the rocky,) by every ſhower and wind, ſo that they all grow lower, and the <hi>valleys</hi> higher; we have a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (beſide thoſe above mention'd Chap. 3. § §. 11, 12,) near the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where there was a <hi>hill</hi> that within me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory interpoſed it ſelf to that height 'twixt it and <hi>Churcham,</hi> that People were wont to goe up into the upper roomes of <hi>Churcham</hi> Manor houſe to ſee the pinnacles of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> whereas after ſome few years they could ſee them on the ground: and as I was inform'd by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Gregory, Rector</hi> there, and <hi>Prebend</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whereas about 12 years ſince they could ſee out of the <hi>Church-yard</hi> at <hi>Churcham</hi> but down to the top of the <hi>upper windows</hi> of the <hi>Steeple,</hi> they can now An. 1684. plainly ſee the <hi>leads</hi> of the <hi>Iſles</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with moſt other <hi>Churches,</hi> and ſome <hi>houſes</hi> in the <hi>Town.</hi> So great have been the <hi>deterrations</hi> from this <hi>hill</hi> in a few years, and no queſtion are ſo

The time of <hi>hatching</hi> their Eggs, by ſome ſort of fowle, has alſo been noted here in ſome places, to be very extraordinary: Thus the worthy Mr. <hi>Chetwynd</hi> in his park at <hi>Ingeſtre</hi> obſerved young <hi>Ravens</hi> to goe to bough on <hi>Newyears day,</hi> which therefore muſt be hatch't in the winter near <hi>Chriſtmaſs;</hi> as ſome alſo were in <hi>Aſhmers Park</hi> near <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> An. 1665, by a <hi>Raven</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly built there for many years.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>MAN,</hi> the Subject matter of the following <hi>Chapter,</hi> being but a ſingle <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>Animal Kingdom,</hi> and that too which the <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>ſpecialiſſima,</hi> whereof there is no variety of inferior <hi>Species</hi>'s that can be hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be found, into which it may be ſubdivided, ſo as to advance any <hi>matter;</hi> one would have thought at firſt ſight ſhould have been ſo narrow a <hi>Theme,</hi> that it might well have been conſider'd in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> among the other <hi>Animals</hi> without danger of prolixity: but <hi>Man</hi> being appointed by his <hi>Creator</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of all below, having the ordering and diſpoſing of all things here both in relation to <hi>Himſelf</hi> and the inferior <hi>Animals;</hi> and not living ſo much within bounds as he ſhould; but debauching his conſtitution with too many <hi>ſenſual delights</hi> of all kinds; has rendred Himſelf lyable in the manage of all theſe <hi>policies,</hi> to ſo many unuſual <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>diſtempers</hi> in the courſe of his life; that I gueſs I may find the <hi>relation</hi> of them, together with thoſe of his <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>death</hi> that have happen'd but within the narrow verge of this <hi>County,</hi> ſufficient to ſupply matter for another <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Which I ſhall treat of (as I ought at leaſt in a <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi>) according to the order of <hi>Nature:</hi> beginning firſt with ſuch uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>accidents</hi> as have befallen <hi>Mankind</hi> at or before his <hi>birth,</hi> then in his courſe of <hi>life,</hi> and laſtly at his <hi>death.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. But before I enter upon the <hi>births</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> it may be worth notice perhaps that I met with one at <hi>Millwich</hi> of a 11 years old, the <hi>child</hi> of one <hi>Philips,</hi> that ſeemed to be <hi>neither;</hi> the <hi>Sex</hi> not being to be diſtinguiſh't by the uſual <hi>marks,</hi> nothing appearing in the place but an unuſual <hi>aperture</hi> of a <hi>raw membrane;</hi> which I gueſs might be nothing elſe but the neck of the <hi>bladder,</hi> the childs <hi>urin</hi> conſtantly diſtilling thence: upon which account of the uncertainty of its <hi>Species,</hi> being in all other parts perfect and well proportion'd, it was Chriſtened <hi>Franc.</hi> this being a <hi>name</hi> in common ſpeech indifferent to both <hi>Sexes.</hi> But I think they needed not have been ſo nice in this matter, had they well conſidered; for though 'tis plain <hi>Nature</hi> was diſappointed in perfecting this <hi>child,</hi> yet ſhe has done enough to ſhew what ſhe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53186:184"/>intended; the <hi>child</hi> ſeeming to have ſomewhat of a <hi>Scrotum</hi> below the <hi>aperture,</hi> though none of the other <hi>eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Manhood,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. All unuſuall <hi>marriages</hi> muſt alſo be precedent to the <hi>births</hi> of <hi>children;</hi> and ſo muſt the <hi>unſeaſonable times</hi> of their Parents <hi>getting</hi> them; a <hi>Man</hi> 'tis true may <hi>marry</hi> at what <hi>age</hi> he pleaſes, but he ſeldom does after <hi>eighty</hi> years of age; much leſs can he get <hi>children</hi> after that time: wherefore <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions it as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing that <hi>Cato Cenſorius,</hi> and <hi>Voluſius Saturninus,</hi> begat <hi>Sons</hi> after they were paſt that age; and that King <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> begat his Son <hi>Mathimathnus</hi> at <hi>eighty ſix</hi> years old; and for <hi>Women</hi> he ſays in general they are paſt <hi>child-bearing</hi> at <hi>fifty</hi>

Yet both theſe fall ſhort of what I met with in this <hi>County</hi> (and which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary) in the ſame <hi>marryed couple:</hi> one <hi>John Beſt</hi> of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Horton</hi> a man of a 104 years of age, having not many years agoe marryed a woman of 56.

Before the <hi>birth</hi> of <hi>Children,</hi> ſo powerfull is the <hi>Pica</hi> or <hi>Longing</hi> of a <hi>Woman,</hi> that in caſe ſhe be not preſently ſupplyed with the <hi>object</hi> of her unreaſonable extravagant <hi>appetite,</hi> ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>marks</hi> her <hi>child</hi> with ſome reſemblance of it: whereof we daily ſee ſo many <hi>examples,</hi> that it would be impertinent <hi>here</hi> to inſtance in any.

But I never met with an inſtance in all my <hi>Travells</hi> where any of theſe <hi>impreſſions</hi> were ſo very ſtrong that they diſmember'd the <hi>Faetus</hi> in the ſame part the object was, which gave the fright, till I came to <hi>Leek,</hi> where <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the wife of <hi>Jeremiah Tomkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> having heard that one <hi>John Heath</hi> a <hi>Black-Smith</hi> who lived in her houſe, upon reading that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Matthew Chap.</hi> 5. v. 30. <hi>[if they right hand offend thee, cut it off]</hi> had repaired to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe a <hi>Wood-man</hi> of <hi>Cunſall,</hi> and taken oportunity with one of his brothers <hi>inſtruments</hi> to cut off his <hi>right hand;</hi> was ſo affected with it, being then about the time of her <hi>conception</hi> (though ſhe ſaw not the fact, nor heard of it till next day after it was done) that ſhe brought forth a man child (whom I ſaw my ſelf <hi>An.</hi> 1681) without a <hi>right hand,</hi> couped at the wriſt much about the place where <hi>John Heath</hi> had cut his hand off.

Alſo before the <hi>birth</hi> of <hi>Children,</hi> ſo many and ſo apparent are the uſual <hi>Symptoms</hi> commonly known by <hi>Women,</hi> about the time of <hi>conception;</hi> during their <hi>goeing</hi> with <hi>child;</hi> and when near their <hi>travel;</hi> that one would think a <hi>woman</hi> truly with <hi>child,</hi> could never be ſo miſtaken, as I was told the wife of <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> of <hi>Mearton</hi> in this <hi>County</hi> really was: who after ſhe had been marryed two years, was brought to bed of a <hi>daughter,</hi> both her ſelf and <hi>husband,</hi> ſo little knowing, or ſo much as thinking ſhe was ever with <hi>child,</hi> that growing ill near the time of her <hi>labour,</hi> they ſent for a <hi>Phyſician</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Midwife.</hi> For one to have all theſe <hi>ſignes,</hi> and yet no <hi>child</hi> at laſt, is pretty common amongſt <hi>women;</hi> nay ſo farr is it from a <hi>miracle</hi> that they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times incident to <hi>ancient women</hi> paſt the age of child bearing, whereof M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Bromwich</hi> of the pariſh of <hi>Newland</hi> in the <hi>Forreſt</hi> of <hi>Dean</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> who had all the Symptoms of a <hi>pregnant

                  </note>: but to have a child in this manner, and none of the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>ſignes,</hi> is ſo very rare, that I have not yet met with a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in all my reading.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Amongſt the <hi>unuſual accidents</hi> in the <hi>birth</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> we muſt reckon the ſurprizing production of <hi>Monſters,</hi> whether in exceſs or defect; to the former of which the ancient <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> have uſually referr'd ſuch as are <hi>born</hi> with <hi>teeth,</hi> it having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look't upon very extraordinary to be ſo born, <hi>children</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom breeding them till the <hi>ſeventh month</hi> after their <hi>birth.</hi> Yet <hi>Sarab Wood</hi> of <hi>Brineton</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Blymhill</hi> An. 1670. was thus born with two teeth, which was anciently accounted very unfortunate both to <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> as in the inſtances of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and our <hi>Richard</hi> the third King of <hi>England,</hi> who were both thus born, and one of them the cauſe of the ruin of <hi>Sueſsa Pometia</hi> a moſt flouriſhing <hi>City</hi>

               <p n="8">8. More deſervedly by much are the <hi>Monſters</hi> of defect, I have met with in this <hi>County,</hi> referr'd hither; ſuch as that of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> the wife of <hi>John Bird</hi> of <hi>Whittington</hi> near <hi>Lichfield,</hi> who <hi>An.</hi> 1679. was brought to bed of a <hi>child</hi> without upper lip, noſe, or eyes; the hands turned upon the armes, and the feet upon the leggs, one of the heels extravagantly large, and a hole in the back without any backbone; it could not ſuck, but took milk and beer freely enough, whereby it lived 3 days, and then dyed. Which 'tis true was a birth imperfect and deformed enough, yet not near ſo much as that of the wife of one <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>great-Heywood,</hi> who in <hi>January</hi> 1684. as I received it in a Letter from my very good Friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Sampſon Birch</hi> Alderman of <hi>Stafford,</hi> beſide a a perfect <hi>ſtill-born child,</hi> was deliver'd of another <hi>monſtrous body,</hi> made up of a large <hi>Cyſtis</hi> or bagg about the thickneſs of a <hi>Mans Scrotum,</hi> ſmooth on the out ſide, and ſomewhat reddiſh, fill'd with a liquid ſlimy matter, but not fetid: in the upper part whereof was a round protuberant <hi>bone</hi> 3 inches and ½ in compaſs coverd with a thick fleſhy Skin beſet with ſhort hairs, in which were placed 8 <hi>dentes molares</hi> in a circular form, having a ſmall hole in the middle which led not farr: below theſe in another <hi>bone</hi> were placed 5 other teeth, alſo of the <hi>molar</hi> kind, four of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53186:186"/>them almoſt in a ſtraight line, and the fift a little below the two uppermoſt, which in ſhape, whiteneſs, &amp;c. all ſo well reſembled <hi>teeth,</hi> that they could not be thought to be any thing elſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Out of the Skin of the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> a little below the uppermoſt <hi>bone,</hi> in which the <hi>eight teeth</hi> are ſet, grew a large <hi>lock</hi> of <hi>hair</hi> of a bright brown colour, whoſe end was intricate and intangled in a larger quantity faſtened in the other end of the <hi>Cyſtis</hi> oppoſite to the <hi>eight teeth</hi> of a more yellowiſh colour: all which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived well enough by the <hi>figure</hi> of it <hi>Tab.</hi> 25. where it is exactly graven in its juſt magnitude. Now for a juſt account of this <hi>Embryo</hi> or <hi>preternatural body</hi> though it cannot be expected, yet I think I may pronounce without any great diffidence, 1. that it muſt come from an <hi>Egg</hi> that deſcended from the <hi>Ovarium</hi> through the <hi>Tube</hi> to the <hi>womb,</hi> as well as that of the <hi>perfect child;</hi> 2. that <hi>Nature</hi> in this birth at firſt intended <hi>Twinns;</hi> and 3 that the <hi>bony</hi> and <hi>fleſhy</hi> parts, out of which grew the <hi>hair,</hi> and the two ſetts of <hi>teeth,</hi> were ſome rudiments deſign'd to form a <hi>head:</hi> but how dame <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> came thus to miſcarry in her <hi>plaſtics,</hi> whether from ſome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal violence</hi> which might break the <hi>Egg</hi> after it came into the <hi>womb?</hi> or whether the <hi>Egg</hi> it ſelf at firſt was imperfect or ſubven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous, out of which <hi>Nature</hi> being unable to form a perfect <hi>Faetus,</hi> made the beſt of what the matter could afford? as the learned D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tyſon</hi> more probably thinks, who has written more at large of it<note n="g" place="bottom">Philoſoph.

               <p n="48">48. Thus having done with the <hi>Women</hi> ſolitarily conſidered, I ſhall next treat of the <hi>Men</hi> and the accidents that have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them during the courſe of their lives in the like manner. And firſt of the extraordinary <hi>perfections</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> whether of body or
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53186:197"/>mind, and then of their <hi>defects.</hi> As for the <hi>perfections</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> I take that of <hi>ſtrength</hi> to be one of the cheifeſt; wherein I met with ſome that excell'd ſo much, that unleſs I had ſeen the things done my ſelf, I ſhould have though them incredible: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of one <hi>Godfrey Witrings</hi> a butcher of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> whome I ſaw take a forme, at <hi>Robert Launders</hi> in the Lane, 6 foot 10 inches long, and 56 pounds weight, by one end in his <hi>teeth</hi> (holding his hands behind him, and bearing the leggs of that end next him againſt his breſt) and lift the other end the whole height of the parlour, ſtriking it 3 times againſt the boards of the room above. Now ſuppoſeing the leggs to ſtand about 10 inches from the end of the <hi>form,</hi> towards the middle, or <hi>center</hi> of <hi>gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is near of the diſtance betwixt the end and the <hi>Center;</hi> by computation he lifted thus with his <hi>teeth</hi> about 168 pounds weight. Which is not ſo much as what was done by a Juglar <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> tells us of, who took up the <hi>maſt</hi> of a ſmall boat with his <hi>teeth,</hi> and threw it firſt upon one ſhoulder, whence he removed it to the other, without touching it with his hands<note n="*" place="bottom">Hieron.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Nor ſo much as was performed by one <hi>Nicholas Cooper</hi> of <hi>Acton-Truſſel,</hi> who was alſo a man of ſo extraordinary ſtrength in thoſe parts, that he could lift a ſack of <hi>wheat</hi> of 4 ſtrike with his <hi>teeth;</hi> which accounting but 50 pounds to the <hi>ſtrike</hi> (than which ſearce any weighs leſs) amounts to 200 pounds weight, but reckoning at 60 pounds <hi>per buſhell</hi> (as ſome <hi>wheat</hi> weighs) he lifted 240. But this was not the utmoſt he could doe neither, for once upon a <hi>wager,</hi> he took up a man, by a coard tyed round him, of 300 weight, and ſet him on a <hi>Table.</hi> Nor was he ſtrong in his <hi>teeth</hi> only but in the whole frame of his body, having taken up at a time 3 ſizeable men, one under each <hi>Arm,</hi> and a third in his <hi>teeth.</hi> Which is not much leſs than that mention'd by <hi>Cardan,</hi> who ſaw a man dance with two under his armes, as many upon his ſhoulders, and one hanging about his neck<note n="q" place="bottom">Ibidem.</note>. And formerly being deſired to give a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of his ſtrength, he ſet his back under the <hi>Axle-tree</hi> of a <hi>Cart</hi> laden with 3 horſload and ½ of <hi>coals,</hi> and not only lifted it <hi>wheels</hi> and all, but turned it quite round. The ſame perſon having a <hi>Leſow</hi> quite overrun with well grown <hi>broom,</hi> near a mans height; whereas others are forced to ſtock or root up ſuch broom with <hi>Matocks</hi> and other <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> he pluck't up all <hi>his</hi> by the <hi>roots</hi> with his hands, though the ground was 4 <hi>Acres.</hi> To whom let me add that one <hi>Thomas Wall</hi> of <hi>Wolver hampton</hi> was once ſo ſtrong in his <hi>teeth,</hi> that he could readily bend a large <hi>nail</hi> or <hi>tenterbook,</hi> and ſet it ſtraight
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53186:198"/>again with them: for the better performance whereof I was told his <hi>teeth</hi> were <hi>molares</hi> before, inſtead of <hi>inciſores;</hi> but upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination I found them not ſo, only indeed his <hi>inciſores</hi> were of an unuſual thickneſs.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Not at all inferior to any of theſe in matters of <hi>ſtrength,</hi> was one <hi>Walter Parſons</hi> of <hi>Weſt-Bromwich</hi> in this <hi>County,</hi> though <hi>his</hi> was not ſo much to be admired as <hi>theirs,</hi> who were Men but of a middleing ordinary ſize, whereas <hi>Parſons</hi> had a ſtature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his ſtrength; being ſo very tall when he was a young <hi>apprentice,</hi> that they were forced to digg a hole in the ground for him to ſtand in up to his knees, when he ſtruck at the <hi>Anvil</hi> (for he was firſt a <hi>Black-Smith</hi>) or ſawed wood with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he might be at a <hi>Level</hi> with his <hi>fellow-workman.</hi> At length he became <hi>Porter</hi> to King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, where he behaved himſelf ſo generouſly, that though he had valour equal to his ſtrength, yet he ſcorned to take advantage to injure any perſon by it; upon which account we have but few <hi>experiments</hi> left us of his great <hi>ſtrength,</hi> but ſuch as were ſportive: as that being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by a man of ordinary ſtature, as he walkt <hi>London</hi> ſtreets, he only took him up by the waſtband of his breeches, and hung him upon one of the hooks in the <hi>ſhambles,</hi> to be ridicul'd by the people, and ſo went his way: and that ſometimes by way of merryment, he would take two of the talleſt <hi>Yeomen</hi> of the <hi>Guard</hi> (like the <hi>Gizard</hi> and <hi>Liver</hi>) under his <hi>Arms,</hi> and carry them as he pleaſed (in ſpight of all reſiſtance) about the <hi>Guard Chamber:</hi> where (if I am not miſinformed) <hi>that</hi> is his <hi>picture</hi> which hangs at the end next the ſtairs, leading down into the Court toward <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gate.</p>
               <p n="51">51. There is another <hi>picture</hi> of him, as I have been told alſo by ſome, in the great room at the <hi>Popes-head</hi> Tavern, in <hi>Popes-head</hi> Alley: but whether they are the true <hi>pictures</hi> of him or noe, it being uncertain that they were drawn in the juſt proportion, I took not the pains to have them meaſur'd; chuſing rather to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what his height might be, from a true meaſure of his hand yet remaining upon a piece of Wainſcot at <hi>Bentley-Hall:</hi> by which it appeare that from the <hi>Carpus</hi> to the end of the <hi>middle finger,</hi> it was eleven inches long, and the <hi>palm</hi> 6 inches broad: which (abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being made interchangeably) is much about the ſize of the hand of <hi>Edmund Malloon</hi> a youth of 19 years old, born at <hi>Port-Leicester</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for his extraordinary ſtature ſhewn publickly here in <hi>Oxford</hi> in 1684, which though from the <hi>Carpus</hi> to the end of the <hi>middle finger</hi> it were 12 inches long, yet the <hi>palm</hi> was no more than five inches broad. i. e. it ſell as much ſhort of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>'s hand in the bredth, as it exceeded it in length.</p>

Now that there ſhould be five <hi>generations</hi> living at a time, as in the preſent examples; or ſix, as in the inſtance of <hi>Mary Cooper</hi> above mentioned, is not indeed ſo wonderfull; ſince if People marry young enough, it may well be ſo: as in the caſe of my Lady <hi>Child</hi> in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Salop,</hi> who as I was credibly informed being marryed at 12, had a Child in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. year of her age; which Child being marryed as young, had another alſo at 13, ſo that this Lady was a <hi>Grand-mother</hi> at 27, and might poſſibly have been a <hi>great Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> at 40, a <hi>great-great-Grand-mother</hi> at 53, and a <hi>Beldam</hi> at 66: but the marriages in our inſtances being not ſo early, the caſes are the more remarkable.

               <p n="28">28. But tho' there is little danger of <hi>overmarling</hi> ſuch ſorts of lands, yet of ſome others there may: and therefore in ſome places they always obſerve the <hi>thickneſs</hi> of their mold above the <hi>Catbrain</hi> (as they call it) i. e. a ſort of barren <hi>clay</hi> and <hi>ſtone</hi> mixt; which if they find but <hi>thin,</hi> they <hi>marle</hi> that land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably <hi>leſs;</hi> but if <hi>thick,</hi> they alſo <hi>marle</hi> it accordingly: for to lay a great deal of <hi>marle</hi> upon <hi>thin</hi> land, will produce but a mean, if any cropp at all.

We find indeed now that it doth not laſt to any great effect above 8 or 9 cropps, yet I beleive the land may be the better for it for ſo long time: for this always in ſome meaſure keeps up the <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>ſoil,</hi> and does not eat it out after the manner of <hi>Lime.</hi> They generally <hi>marle</hi> their lands in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> but for no other reaſon, but that they have moſt leaſure then, it being betwixt <hi>ſeed-time,</hi> and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi>

Another odd ſort of <hi>Art</hi> I was told of in this <hi>County,</hi> which muſt not be omitted, of curing the diſeaſe in <hi>Cattle</hi> they here call the <hi>Foule,</hi> that proceeds as 'tis though from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <hi>fatneſs,</hi> which ſometimes falling into their <hi>leggs</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> cauſes ſuch <hi>impoſtumes</hi> or <hi>cores</hi> of putrifyed matter, that they cannot goe farr: upon which account tho' the <hi>beef</hi> of them be never the worſe for the <hi>ſhambles,</hi> yet being rendered hereby uncapable of being brought to a profitable <hi>Market,</hi> their <hi>owners</hi> are therefore forced to have recourſe to ſome <hi>remedy,</hi> which is commonly <hi>this.</hi> They ſtricktly obſerve the <hi>turf,</hi> where the <hi>Oxe, Cow,</hi> or <hi>Heifer</hi> that is thus diſtemper'd, ſets his <hi>ſick foot</hi> when he firſt riſes in the morning, upon which they uſually find ſome of the <hi>Sanies</hi> or matter of the <hi>impoſtume</hi> preſſt out by his weight; this very <hi>turf</hi> with the <hi>impreſſion</hi> upon it, they cut up and hang upon a <hi>tree</hi> or <hi>hedg</hi> toward the <hi>North</hi> wind, which blowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it the <hi>beaſt</hi> becomes cured in three or four days: and this I was told about <hi>Tamworth</hi> was frequently practiſed there with good ſucceſs to this day. Which as S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> thinks ſeems indeed to be done, by a <hi>Sympathetic</hi> return of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumated matter, now mixt with the cold and dry <hi>Atoms</hi> of the <hi>North</hi> wind, to their firſt <hi>ſource</hi> in the ulcerated foot of the <hi>Animal;</hi> the <hi>malady</hi> indeed requiring no other help, than to be well dryed and refreſh't, which is effectually doen by the cold nitrous particles of the <hi>Air</hi> coming from that <hi>quarter</hi>

Laſtly we come to the <hi>Arts</hi> that reſpect <hi>Mankind,</hi> amongſt which as elſewhere the civility of precedence muſt be allowed to the <hi>women,</hi> and that as well in puniſhments as favours. For the former whereof, they have ſuch a peculiar <hi>artifice</hi> at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Walſall,</hi> for correcting of <hi>Scolds,</hi> which it does too ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and ſo very ſafely, that I look upon it as much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the <hi>Cucking-Stoole,</hi> which not only endangers the <hi>health</hi> of the <hi>party,</hi> but alſo gives the <hi>tongue</hi> liberty 'twixt every dipp; to neither of which this is at all lyable: it being ſuch a <hi>Bridle</hi> for the <hi>tongue,</hi> as not only quite deprives them of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> but brings ſhame for the tranſgreſſion, and humility thereupon, before 'tis taken off. Which being an <hi>inſtrument</hi> ſcarce hard of, much leſs ſeen, I have here preſented it to the <hi>Readers</hi> view <hi>Tab.</hi> 32. <hi>Fig.</hi> 9. as it was taken from the original one, made of <hi>Iron,</hi> at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> under <hi>Lyme.</hi> Wherein the Letter <hi>a,</hi> ſhews the joynted <hi>collar</hi> that comes round the <hi>neck; b, c,</hi> the <hi>loops</hi> and <hi>ſtaples,</hi> to let it out and in, according to the bigneſs and ſlenderneſs of the <hi>neck; d,</hi> the joynted ſemicircle that comes over the <hi>head,</hi> made forked at one end to let through the <hi>noſe;</hi> and <hi>e,</hi> the <hi>plate</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> that is put into the <hi>mouth,</hi> and keeps down the <hi>tongue.</hi> Which being put upon the <hi>offender</hi> by order of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and faſtned with a <hi>padlock</hi> behind, ſhe is lead round the Towne by an <hi>Officer</hi> to her ſhame, nor is it taken off, till after the party begins to ſhew all external ſignes imaginable of humiliation and amendment. And as for any other <hi>Arts</hi> that concern this <hi>Sex,</hi> in one of the lodging rooms at <hi>Trentham Hall</hi> I was ſhewn a moſt delicate linnen ſuit of <hi>hangings,</hi> which being made by <hi>Nunns,</hi> and moſt artificially done, belong to this place, and muſt not be omitted; tho' I muſt confeſs my inability to deſcribe them to that advantage they really deſerve, the whole conſiſting all of <hi>ſquare panes;</hi> ſome great, others little, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving uniformity; the one half plain, the other wrought in <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> with a <hi>topiary</hi> ſort of <hi>Needlework</hi> of ſo great variety, that it is hard (if at all) to find two alike, tho' they are in number great and ſmall, as well as I could tell them, 3317 <hi>Squares.</hi>

As for the <hi>Arts</hi> relating to <hi>Men,</hi> it muſt not be expected that any great <hi>improvements,</hi> much leſs any new <hi>Inventions</hi> ſhould have been made here in thoſe we call <hi>Liberal:</hi> but amongſt the <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics,</hi> I met with ſeveral uſefull and curious things: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a <hi>Smiths</hi> ſhop a little <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Mole-Copp,</hi> I found an Engine
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53186:258"/>that managed a large <hi>Sledg</hi> to ſo great advantage, that it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplyed the defect of a man ordinarily had elſewhere for that purpoſe, the <hi>Sledg</hi> being ſet in an <hi>Axis</hi> of wood, from whence goes a rodd of <hi>Iron</hi> faſtned to a <hi>pallet,</hi> that reaches out a little beyond the <hi>Anvil,</hi> which being drawn down by the foot of the <hi>Smith,</hi> who keeps time to it with his <hi>Hand-Hammer,</hi> is returned again by three <hi>ſprings</hi> of <hi>holly,</hi> that claſp the <hi>Axis</hi> the contrary way. The ſame I alſo found at <hi>Betley, Caverſwall,</hi> and elſewhere, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different from that near <hi>Mole-Copp,</hi> the <hi>Sledg</hi> being return'd by two poles above it, like the <hi>pole</hi> of a <hi>turning-lat he,</hi> whereas the <hi>ſprings</hi> of the former were faſtned below it. For the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding whereof, and becauſe altogether unknown in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts, I have cauſed its <hi>figure</hi> to be exhibited <hi>Tab.</hi> 32. <hi>Fig.</hi> 10.

Thus having ſhewn the reaſon of the diſtribution of the <hi>golden number</hi> in general, it remains that I give a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account how it comes to paſs, that the <hi>following golden number</hi> ſhould be made by adding 8 to the <hi>preceding;</hi> and the <hi>preceding</hi> by adding, 11 to the <hi>following:</hi> for the firſt whereof, I take the reaſon to be, that in 8 <hi>Solar</hi> years, allowing to each 365 days and 6 h. which are 2922 days, there happen to be 99 <hi>Lunations</hi> wanting one day, 12 h. 41′. 15″ 9‴; upon which account after 8 years the <hi>Lunations</hi> doe not begin upon the ſame day they did 8 years before, but one day and ½ later, <hi>proxime;</hi> wherefore after every <hi>golden number</hi> through the whole <hi>Calendar,</hi> another is written next it which exceeds it by <hi>eight,</hi> to ſhew that after 8 years the <hi>New Moons</hi> will not fall upon thoſe days, upon which the <hi>antecedent golden numbers</hi> are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but upon thoſe to which the <hi>numbers</hi> are prefix't, that are made off them by <hi>eight.</hi> And becauſe in twice 8 years, the twice 12 hours and odd minutes make another <hi>day</hi> and better, therefore the <hi>golden numbers</hi> are not always immediatly put after each other upon all days of the months, but every <hi>third</hi> day, for the moſt part, is left vacant for theſe twice 12 hours; ſo that every two <hi>golden numbers</hi> have ordinarily 3 days allowed them, otherwiſe the <hi>Lunations</hi> in each 16 years time, would be always anticipated one day at leſt.</p>
               <p n="58">58. And the reaſon why every <hi>preceding golden number</hi> is formed of the <hi>ſubſequent</hi> by adding 11 is, becauſe in 11 <hi>Solar</hi> years, in which are 417 days, there are 136 <hi>Lunations</hi> and one day, 14 h. 8′. 47″. 4‴. for that in 136 <hi>Lunations</hi> there are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired only 4016 days 3 h. 51′. 12″. 56‴. and therefore the <hi>New Moones</hi> after 11 years, fall not on the ſame days they did the ſaid 11 years before, but one day and almoſt half another ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: upon which account before every <hi>golden number,</hi> is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>golden number</hi> that exceeds it by 11, to ſhew that after 11 years, the <hi>New Moons</hi> will not fall upon thoſe days they did 11 years before, but ſooner, <hi>viz.</hi> upon thoſe to which the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> are prefixt, that are made off them by the addition of 11. Whence <hi>Clavius</hi> concludes that <hi>Campanus</hi> and many others of the ancient <hi>Computiſts,</hi> did not rightly ſet two <hi>golden numbers</hi> before <hi>Decemb</hi> 2<note n="l" place="bottom">Chriſtoph.

                  </note> for that after 11 years the <hi>New Moons</hi> that fell upon that day (the <hi>golden numbers</hi> being 13 or 2) will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily happen one day and near ½ ſooner, as was ſhewn above; for evidence whereof, if theſe were rightly ſet, there muſt alſo be two other <hi>golden numbers</hi> put the day preceding, <hi>viz.</hi> 5
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53186:282"/>and 13. and ſo two more again for them, and ſo quite through the <hi>Calendar:</hi> ſo that every day that has any, muſt have two <hi>golden numbers</hi> as well as this, and two <hi>New Moones</hi> falling on it within the <hi>cycle;</hi> whereas no other day but this even by theſe <hi>Computiſts</hi> is allowed above one, and theſe ſufficient too, to take up all the <hi>New-Moons.</hi> Upon which account I rather cloſe with <hi>Clavius,</hi> and place the number 13 upon the firſt of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> and 2 alone upon the ſecond, as I find them upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe <hi>Cloggs,</hi> tho' not in that repreſented above, 13 in that being put down to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and 2 to the <hi>third,</hi> in which point I therefore count it defective, nor can I ſee any inconvenience that will follow hence, but that the <hi>Emboliſmal month</hi> (the <hi>golden number</hi> being 13) muſt then be reckon'd from <hi>Dec.</hi> 1. to the 31. as <hi>Clavius</hi> does<note n="m" place="bottom">Idem Calendar.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53186:283"/>the ſame purpoſe: that was to be reputed the <hi>Paſchal Moone,</hi> whoſe <hi>Full</hi> fell not on, but next after the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> or 21 of March, on which day if <hi>Sunday,</hi> or elſe the next <hi>Sunday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Eaſter</hi> was always to be obſerved. So that the years of the <hi>Moons Cycle</hi> being ſettled as above, no body had then, nor has now more to doe, to find the time of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> but to conſult in their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendars</hi> the <hi>golden number</hi> for the year within that compaſs, which ſhews the time of the <hi>Paſchal New-Moone,</hi> and to count 14 from it; or to find out the next <hi>Full-Moone</hi> after the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Equinox;</hi> upon which day if <hi>Sunday</hi> (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) or the next <hi>Sunday</hi> after, <hi>Eaſter</hi> is to be kept. Whence it is that theſe numbers are ſometimes call'd the <hi>Prime,</hi> becauſe they doe <hi>indicare primas Lunas,</hi> and not only near <hi>Eaſter,</hi> but through the whole year; which was eſteemed by our <hi>anceſtors</hi> a thing of ſo excellent uſe, that they ſcrupled not to ſet them in the <hi>margins</hi> of their <hi>Calendars</hi> in characters of <hi>gold,</hi> whence they are ſtiled to this day, alſo the <hi>golden number.</hi>

            <p>That whoever ſubſcribeth for ſix Copies of the ſaid <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in Quires, or procureth Subſcriptions for ſo many, ſhall receive Seven ſuch Copies Imprinted, with a fair Letter, upon very good Paper in <hi>Folio;</hi> every Book contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near 40 half ſheet Cutts wrought off from Copper Plates, beſide the Map, which will be larger than that of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire;</hi> to be prized at no more than a penny <hi>per</hi> ſheet, and a penny <hi>per</hi> Plate, and the Map at Sixpence, which for each Copy (he gueſſes will amount to about Ten or Twelve ſhillings, for thoſe of ordinary Paper, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably more for the larger and finer Paper.</p>
            <p>All which Subſcribers are deſired to take Notice.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it being intended that the ſaid <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſhall be with all convenient ſpeed publiſhed, it will be expedient that all <hi>Subſcribers</hi> Names be returned to the ſame Doctor at his Chamber at <hi>Univerſity College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the firſt of <hi>March</hi> next, 1680, about which time the ſaid Book will be put into the Preſs, that He may know what number to Print, it being intended that the Copies ſhall not much exceed the number of Subſcriptions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That there ſhall be places aſſigned in the <hi>Gazett</hi> when the Impreſſion of the ſaid Book is finiſhed, in <hi>London, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> where all ſuch <hi>Subſcribers</hi> may call or ſend for their Books, and pay their Mony.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That tho the ſaid Book in the ordinary Paper be prized no higher than ten or twelve ſhillings, yet at the uſual and ordinary price of Books ſo full of Cuts, it will be well worth near twenty ſhillings.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That all <hi>Subſcribers</hi> intending to have Books of the larger and finer Paper, are deſired to ſignifie it by an <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk</hi> affixed to their Names, that proviſion may be made for them accordingly.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That all <hi>Subſcribers</hi> whatever, ſhall have their Names regiſtred to Poſterity, in a Printed Catalogue annex't to the Book, as <hi>Benefactors</hi> to the Work, and <hi>Promoters</hi> of the Honor of their Country, as followeth.</p>
